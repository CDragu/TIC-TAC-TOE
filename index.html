<p>I started this project as a challenge to prove to myself that I can get a game done on a custom platform. This was a thing that I only dreamed about in the past I was surprised when I learned how easy it can be. I started with an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> because its an easy to code and easy to deploy on hardware platform.</p>

<p>The subject of the project wasn't choose on random. I knew the limitation of the hardware and I knew that I won't be able to push the refresh rate of the screen to a high enough number to create fluid movement. With this in mind I started to think about what games don't require a lot of movement and the answer was simple: Boardgames. The second thing is that I didn't want was to make the user learn new mechanics. The end result was that everybody knows the rules to Tic-Tac-Toe. So the game was settled.</p>

<p>The first challenge that I encountered was trying to make the LCD screen to work. This was partially my fault because I bought a cheap one from Aliexpress. Not that the service was bad but because there was no documentation and no API for it. After a couple of searches I found a similar enough one and just changed the Pins variables to suit my board.
  The second problem was the accuracy of the touch display. The first time it was touched it defaulted to 0,0 on the coordinates. I resolved that problem by making the user hold his finger on the display if he want's to place a symbol.</p>

<p>I think this was a good project to start with. I learned a lot about how to modify Arduino libraries and about how to make a game usable for the players. One of the thing that I took out of this is to never give up on hardware if you don't have the software for it. One lessons that I see is very used in the console market where developers learn to master hardware during a product lifetime, so the games increase in complexity over the ages.</p>
